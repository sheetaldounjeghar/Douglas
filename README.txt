Note:

1. The program is made using these tools - Java, Eclipse, Selenium Webdriver and TestNG.
2. Currently the functionality is meant to run only for lipsticks category i.e, Lippenstifte.
As the page structure for other products are different and couldn't match the xpath.
3. The program would currently run only on chrome.

Things to makesure before running the code:

1. Make sure all the libraries are set for Selenium and Testing.
2. The Chromdriver path is set according to the path written in code.
